# Artificial-neural--network-number-recognizer

**Written Number Recognizer**

Welcome to the Written Number Recognizer repository! This project is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model designed to recognize handwritten digits. Whether you're a machine learning enthusiast, a student, or a developer looking to implement digit recognition in your applications, this repository has got you covered.

### Overview:

The Written Number Recognizer is built using Python and utilizes popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras for developing and training the neural network model. The goal is to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) provided as input images into their respective numeric representations.

### Features:

- **Digit Recognition**: Identify handwritten digits with high accuracy.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Easily customizable architecture to experiment with different neural network configurations.
- **Modular Design**: Organized codebase with separate modules for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models for future use without the need for retraining.
- **Interactive Demo**: Optionally, an interactive demo or GUI can be developed to showcase the model's capabilities.

### Dataset:

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset for handwritten digit recognition tasks. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels.

### Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, if required)

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Optionally, customize the model architecture, training parameters, and data preprocessing steps as needed.
4. Train the model using the provided scripts or notebooks.
5. Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset.
6. Save the trained model for future use or deployment.
7. Integrate the model into your applications for handwritten digit recognition tasks.
